# Delhi Metro Network Analysis
This repository contains data and analysis related to the Delhi Metro network. The primary data file Delhi-Metro-Network.csv contains information about Delhi Metro stations, including their names, opening dates, lines, distances from start, layouts, and geographical coordinates. The Jupyter Notebook Delhi_Metro_Analysis.ipynb contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing the data.

## Data Preprocessing
### 1 . Converting Opening Date to Date Time Data Type:
  The opening dates of the metro stations have been converted to the datetime data type to facilitate analysis over time.
## Analysis and Visualizations
### 1 . Plotting Graph: Number of Stations Opened Each Year:

This analysis visualizes the number of stations opened each year, providing insights into the expansion of the Delhi Metro network over time.
### 2 . Plotting Graph: Number of Stations v/s Different Metro Lines:

This analysis explores the distribution of stations across different metro lines, highlighting the lines with the highest and lowest numbers of stations.
### 3 . Plotting Graph: Number of Stations vs. Different Types of Metro Station Layouts:

This analysis examines the distribution of stations based on their layout types, such as elevated, underground, etc., offering insights into the infrastructure of the Delhi Metro network.
## Usage
To reproduce the analysis:

#### 1.Clone this repository to your local machine.
#### 2.Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
#### 3.Open Delhi_Metro_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
#### 4.Follow the code cells to execute the analysis steps.
#### 5.View the generated visualizations within the notebook.
